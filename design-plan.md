- !!!THE PLAYER HAS TO BE GREATLY ECOURAGED TO BUILD A LOT
- !!!CHANGES TO THE WORLD NEED TO BE NOTICEABLE

- progression heavily relies on monoliths - things you'd craft with combining mob loot/natural resources/boss loot
- they can give you permanent buffs, make the game harder but more rewarding or be interactable (with something like boss summons) 
- the hell area is possible but very hard without them as it burns you if you dont have it

- the world is square and relatively small
- the main world with all the layers is mutable, but players can travel to immutable or temporary worlds either through get-once portals or altars which require summoning items (idk how to call them)
- there is an odd amount of layers arranged vertically, the player spawns on the middle one
- there are variants of these layers on the sides of the world, making them harder
- every layer is necessary
- vertical mobility is challenging and making it better is part of the progression
- all layers should be accessible to the player at all times, with the barrier of entry being that they're too hard to make use of if you haven't progressed enough
- being dense and meaningful has to be a big point, but mobility upgrades should feel like they matter

- every weapon has to be unique and upgradeable
- maybe a tinker's construct kinda system?
- quality over quantity with weapons
- accessories should function like in hypixel skyblock and magic power should play a big role
- there should be 3-4 accessory slots depending on the player's progression
- all accessories have a passive effect when they're anywhere and an active effect when they're in that slot

- npcs function like terraria expect you need to prioritise their happiness. it should be randomized, but always possible to get to certain milestones
- money has to be necessary for progression, and there should always be ways to pick a cheaper but harder option
- the best moneymaking methods should involve travel. for example, you could get something in layer 2 which is 200t, but then use it to do another task which is similar in difficulty in layer 2Left which will yield 350t-450t or a harder task in layer -1 which yields 500t-550t
- the pylon system has to be good
- their happiness has to depend not only on their location and neighbours, but also on their housing somehow

- a skill system like hypixel skyblock's, each layer has its own skill
